Version 3 has been recoded from scratch using the [JAMES framework](http://www.jamesframework.org) which provides the applied optimization algorithms. A lot of new features have been added such as the ability to sample cores based on multiple types of genetic marker data, phenotypic traits or a precomputed distance matrix. New and improved evaluation measures were also included, that can be separately or simultaneously optimized.\r\n\r\n## Getting started with Core Hunter\r\nCore Hunter is implemented in Java and can be executed from R or using the graphical interface. In both cases you will need to have installed a [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) version 8 or later.\r\n\r\n#### R Package\r\nThe package `corehunter` is available on CRAN and can be installed with\r\n```R\r\n> install.packages(\"corehunter\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards, load the package\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> library(corehunter)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand add your data, e.g.\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> my.genotypes <- genotypes(file = \"path/to/file\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSampling a core collection is then as easy as\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> sampleCore(my.genotypes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are numerous options when sampling a core. For example, you can change the size of the core (defaults to 20%), optimize a specific measure (defaults to average entry-to-nearest-entry distance), maximize a weighted index including multiple measures, change stop conditions (by default, the algorithm stops when it was unable to further improve the core during the last 10 seconds), etc. All functions have detailed documentation, for example try\r\n\r\n```R\r\n> ?sampleCore\r\n> ?objective\r\n> ?genotypes\r\n> ?phenotypes\r\n> ?distances\r\n> ?coreHunterData\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany examples are included in the R package as well.\r\n\r\n#### Graphical interface\r\nA simple graphical interface is under development. More information will be posted here soon.\r\n\r\n## Supported data types\r\nCore Hunter 3 supports multiple types of genetic marker data, phenotypic traits and precomputed distance matrices. Data can be loaded from files, or from data frames and matrices when using the R package. More information and examples will be posted here soon.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation measures\r\nOne of the main strengths of Core Hunter is that it can directly optimize a number of different evaluation measures.\r\nIf desired, multiple measures can be simultaneously optimized as part of a weighted index.\r\nThe measures included in Core Hunter 3 are listed below.\r\n\r\n#### Distance based measures\r\n\r\n- Average entry-to-nearest-entry distance (diversity)\r\n- Average accession-to-nearest-entry distance (representativeness)\r\n- Average entry-to-entry distance (provided for historical reasons, not preferred)\r\n\r\nGower's distance is used to compute distances from phenotypic traits, and both the Modified Roger's as well as Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards distances are supported for genetic marker data. Alternatively, a precomputed distance matrix can be used.\r\n\r\n#### Allelic richness\r\n\r\n- Shannon's index\r\n- Expected heterozygosity\r\n- Allele coverage\r\n\r\nAvailable for genetic marker data only.",
