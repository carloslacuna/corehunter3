      <p>Looking for the old Core Hunter 2 website? It's <a href="v2/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-is-core-hunter" class="anchor" href="#what-is-core-hunter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Core Hunter?</h2>

<p>Core Hunter is a flexible tool for multi-purpose core subset selection. Version 3 has been recoded from scratch using the <a href="http://www.jamesframework.org">JAMES framework</a> which provides the applied optimization algorithms. A lot of new features have been added such as the ability to sample cores based on multiple types of genetic marker data, phenotypic traits or a precomputed distance matrix. New and improved evaluation measures were also included, that can be separately or simultaneously optimized.</p>

<h2>
<a id="getting-started-with-core-hunter" class="anchor" href="#getting-started-with-core-hunter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started with Core Hunter</h2>

<p>Core Hunter is implemented in Java and can be executed from R or using the graphical interface. In both cases you will need to have installed a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a> version 8 or later.</p>

<h3>
<a id="r-package" class="anchor" href="#r-package" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>R Package</h3>

<p>The package <code>corehunter</code> is available on CRAN and can be installed with</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-r"><pre><span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> install.packages(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>corehunter<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)</pre></div>

<p>Afterwards, load the package</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-r"><pre><span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> library(<span class="pl-smi">corehunter</span>)</pre></div>

<p>and add your data, e.g.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-r"><pre><span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">my.genotypes</span> <span class="pl-k">&lt;-</span> genotypes(<span class="pl-v">file</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>path/to/file<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)</pre></div>

<p>Sampling a core collection is then as easy as</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-r"><pre><span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> sampleCore(<span class="pl-smi">my.genotypes</span>)</pre></div>

<p>There are numerous options when sampling a core. For example, you can change the size of the core (defaults to 20%), optimize a specific measure (defaults to average entry-to-nearest-entry distance), maximize a weighted index including multiple measures, change stop conditions (by default, the algorithm stops when it was unable to further improve the core during the last 10 seconds), etc. All functions have detailed documentation, for example try</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-r"><pre><span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">sampleCore</span>
<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">objective</span>
<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">genotypes</span>
<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">phenotypes</span>
<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">distances</span>
<span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> ?<span class="pl-smi">coreHunterData</span></pre></div>

<p>Many examples are included in the R package as well.</p>

<h3>
<a id="graphical-interface" class="anchor" href="#graphical-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Graphical interface</h3>

<p>A simple graphical interface is under development. More information will be posted here soon.</p>

<h2>
<a id="supported-data-types" class="anchor" href="#supported-data-types" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported data types</h2>

<p>Core Hunter 3 supports multiple types of genetic marker data, phenotypic traits and precomputed distance matrices. Data can be loaded from files and, when using the R package, from data frames and matrices.</p>

<h3>
<a id="genetic-marker-data" class="anchor" href="#genetic-marker-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Genetic marker data</h3>

<p>Genotypes can be provided in various formats.</p>

<h4>
<a id="default-format" class="anchor" href="#default-format" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Default format</h4>

<p>The default format contains one row per accession and one or more columns per marker. It is suited for data with a fixed number of allele observations per specific marker in each individual. The values are allele names or numbers, or in fact any token used to identify the detected alleles. Common cases are those with one or two columns per marker, e.g. suited for homozygous/haploid and diploid data, respectively. The number of observed alleles may vary across markers.</p>

<p>There is one compulsory header column <code>ID</code> specifying unique accession identifiers. Optionally, a second header column <code>NAME</code> can be included to provide names as well, which need not be unique nor defined for all accessions. The single header row contains marker names which are repeated for each column corresponding to the same marker. Optionally, column names may include a suffix added to the marker name, starting with a <code>.</code>, <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> character. For example, in the case of diploid data, it is allowed that the two columns corresponding to the same marker have names like <code>M5.1</code> &amp; <code>M5.2</code>, <code>M17-a</code> &amp; <code>M17-b</code> or  <code>X_1</code> &amp; <code>X_2</code>, for markers named <code>M5</code>, <code>M17</code> and <code>X</code>, respectively. The column name prefix up to before the last occurrence of any <code>.</code>, <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> character is taken to be the marker name.</p>

<p>This format can not be used for bulk samples. For such data the frequency format should be used.</p>

<h4>
<a id="frequency-data" class="anchor" href="#frequency-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Frequency data</h4>

<p>This is the original format from Core Hunter 1 and 2, but it has been transposed to follow the convention that rows are observations (accessions) and columns are variables (marker alleles). This format contains one row per accession and one column per combination of marker and allele. The values are allele frequencies. At least one column (allele) is provided per marker and the number of alleles per marker may vary.</p>

<p>There is one compulsory header column <code>ID</code> specifying unique accession identifiers. Optionally, a second header column <code>NAME</code> can be included to provide names as well, which need not be unique nor defined for all accessions. The first, compulsory header row contains marker names, which are repeated for each consecutive column corresponding to the same marker. An optional second header row <code>ALLELE</code> can be included to provide allele names per marker.</p>

<p>This format is suitable for entries of individual or bulk samples.</p>

<h4>
<a id="biparental-data" class="anchor" href="#biparental-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Biparental data</h4>

<p>This format describes genetic marker data with two alleles per marker. It contains one row per accession and one column per marker with values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> denoting the number of detected occurrences of an arbitrary reference allele. Thus, the values <code>0</code> and <code>2</code> indicate homozygotes of the two alleles, respectively, while <code>1</code> is used for a heterozygote.</p>

<p>There is one compulsory header column <code>ID</code> specifying unique accession identifiers. Optionally, a second header column <code>NAME</code> can be included to provide names as well, which need not be unique nor defined for all accessions. The single header row may optionally provide marker names.</p>

<p>This format is only suited for data where each marker has (at most) two possible alleles and can not be used to describe bulked data.</p>

<h3>
<a id="precomputed-distance-matrix" class="anchor" href="#precomputed-distance-matrix" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Precomputed distance matrix</h3>

<p>Core Hunter can load an arbitrary distance matrix computed from any type of data using any distance measure. The matrix contains one row and one column per accession, in the same order, which effectively means that the matrix should be symmetric.</p>

<p>There is one compulsory header column <code>ID</code> which provides unique accession identifiers. Optionally, a second header column <code>NAME</code> can be included to provide names as well, which need not be unique nor defined for all items. Accession identifiers can optionally be repeated on the single header row.</p>

<p>Any row in the matrix can be truncated at or after the diagonal. The diagonal values should always be zero, when included. If some or all entries of the upper triangular part of the matrix are included, it is verified whether they match the lower triangular part, i.e. whether the matrix is effectively symmetric. Truncated values in the upper triangular part are copied from the lower triangular part.</p>

<p>This data type is particularly interesting when dealing with genetic marker data having a very large number of markers, as precomputing the distance matrix is then also an effective way to compress the data. It can also be used to run Core Hunter with data types and/or distance measures that are otherwise not supported.</p>

<h3>
<a id="phenotypic-trait-data" class="anchor" href="#phenotypic-trait-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phenotypic trait data</h3>

<p>This data describes observed phenotypic traits and can accommodate several variable types. The format used by Core Hunter includes one row per accession and one column per trait.</p>

<p>There must be one compulsory header column <code>ID</code> with unique accession identifiers. A second optional column <code>NAME</code> can be added to provide names as well, which need not be unique nor defined for all items. The first row contains the trait names, which need not be unique, but should be unique for later identification. Optionally, a second header row with header <code>TYPE</code> can be added which specifies the variable type of each trait (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and optionally the data type. Please refer to the tables below. If this row is not included in the file, variable types are automatically inferred or can be set manually when using the R package, but will default to nominal strings when using the GUI. It is recommended to always specify variable types.</p>

<p>Two more optional rows can be added for ordinal, interval and ratio data to provide indicative minimum and maximum values, with the row headers <code>MIN</code> and <code>MAX</code>, respectively. If indicative minimum and maximum values are not provided these are calculated from the data. If the data exceed these minimum and maximum values, the actual minimum and maximum values are adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h2>
<a id="evaluation-measures" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-measures" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Evaluation measures</h2>

<p>One of the main strengths of Core Hunter is that it can directly optimize a number of different evaluation measures.
If desired, multiple measures can be simultaneously optimized as part of a weighted index.
The measures included in Core Hunter 3 are listed below.</p>

<h3>
<a id="distance-based-measures" class="anchor" href="#distance-based-measures" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Distance based measures</h3>

<ul>
<li>Average entry-to-nearest-entry distance (diversity)</li>
<li>Average accession-to-nearest-entry distance (representativeness)</li>
<li>Average entry-to-entry distance (provided for historical reasons, not preferred)</li>
</ul>

<p>Gower's distance is used to compute distances from phenotypic traits, and both the Modified Roger's as well as Cavalli-Sforza &amp; Edwards distances are supported for genetic marker data. Alternatively, a precomputed distance matrix can be used.</p>

<h3>
<a id="allelic-richness" class="anchor" href="#allelic-richness" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Allelic richness</h3>

<ul>
<li>Shannon's index</li>
<li>Expected heterozygosity</li>
<li>Allele coverage</li>
</ul>

<p>Available for genetic marker data only.</p>
