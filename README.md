Version 3 of CoreHunter has been recoded from scratch using the [JAMES framework](http://www.jamesframework.org) which provides the applied optimization algorithms. A lot of new features will be added such as direct support for phenotypic data, biallelic marker data (e.g. SNP) and precomputed distance matrices.
